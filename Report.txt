We found out that we had an object in Runner.java, which stored plane types and we were
using different classes to initialize different objects in the same list.

We created an interface called Aircraft.java with a common function getModel.
Which was then implemented in Helicopter, PassengerDrone and PassengerPlane.
Now this was used by Aircraft factory which provided a common Constructor to return
a type of Aircraft objects.

Which was then used in Runner with parameters.
